  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>What makes these brownies the peak of chocolatey perfection is the contrast between the crisp top layer and the fudgy interior. And technique plays an important role: The chocolate pieces need to go into the batter whole, not roughly chopped.</p>
    
  <p>Further, a thicker slab like the Baker's ones I used ends up to be essential, as well. A Hershey's bar doesn't work: it's too thin and flimsy to impart that signature richness to fudge brownies. Finally, as the chocolate pieces sink into the batter and melt, the bottom layer of the brownies becomes a thin layer of solid chocolate. </p>
